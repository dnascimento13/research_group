          <h2> October 8, 2024 </h2>
          <p> Our manuscript in collaboration with Amy Cordones (Stanford Pulse Institute) is out in the <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jacs.4c11667">Journal of the American Chemical Society</a>! </p>
	  <p> In this work, we explore how sulfur 1s3p resonant inelastic x-ray scattering can be used to reveal metal-ligand covalency in the valence excited states of metal dithiolenes.</p>

          <h2> October 5, 2024 </h2>
          <p> Nathaniel Gillispie joins the group as a PhD student. Welcome Nathan! </p>

          <h2> September 10, 2024 </h2>
          <p> The Nascimento Group is awarded an NSF Collaborative grant to develop electronic structure methods in the Psi4 code. </p>

          <h2> September 1, 2024 </h2>
          <p> Dr. Nascimento is named a "University of Memphis Research Foundation" (UMRF) Research Professor. </p>

          <h2> August 22, 2024 </h2>
          <p> Dr. Nascimento receives the 2024 CAS Early Career Research Award. This Award is given by the College of Arts and Sciences in recognition of faculty members with outstanding research programs in the early stages of their career.</p>

          <h2> March 19, 2024 </h2>
              <p> Our manuscript describing the role of the coupling matrix elements in time-dependent density functional theory on the simulation of core-level spectra of transition metal complexes is out in <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2516-1075/ad2693/meta">
                        Electronic Structure</a>!</p>
              <p> In this work, we systematically investigate the importance of coulomb, exchange and exchange-correlation terms in the excited-state response of core-level states when using hybrid DFT functionals. This is also Sarah's first first-author paper. Congratulations Sarah!</p>

          <h2> February 14, 2024 </h2>
              <p> Our manuscript in collaboration with Irene Conti and Artur Nenov (University of Bologna, Italy) is out in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/php.13922">
                        Photochemistry and Photobiology</a>!</p>
              <p> In this work, we demonstrate the potential of TD-DFT methods in describing the photophysics of DNA. We show that the topology of the potential energy surfaces of electronic states involved in the photoinduced relaxation of uridine can be correclty captured by TD-DFT if the description of the surrounding environment is taken into consideration.</p>
